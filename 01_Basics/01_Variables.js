const accountId = 1234;
let accountEmail = "user@gmail.com";
var accountPassword = "user@123";

let accountState;
// accountId = 12345;
accountEmail = "user123@gmail.com";

console.log(accountId);
console.log(accountEmail);
console.log(accountPassword);

//In javascript we can not redefine const variable it compiler give assignment to constant variable error which means you can not redefine the variable which in const scope keep in mind

// new console log output which i don't know about which is this:
console.table([accountId ,accountEmail, accountPassword, accountState]);
// this will log the value in tabular form which is very cool LOL :)
